<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
  The <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
  is a project to make a book and screencasts to teach web development
  with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. This
  is the sample application for the tutorial.
  This is an application for tracking the leaves of the employees of a company.
  Generally when employees take leave the other employees don't know about it.
  This causes problems as people are not able to plan accordingly. This application
  helps people to track which all people are absent on a particular day so that they
  can make their plans accordingly.
